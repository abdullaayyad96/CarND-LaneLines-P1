**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.


My pipeline consisted of 8 main steps.
    1. Obtaining an image with only white and yellow segments.
        * White color detection was done on an RGB version of the image where all channels must be larger than a threshold = 200
        * Yellow color detection was done on an HSV version of the image where only pixels that satisfy the Hue, Saturation and Value conditions were considered
    2. Obtaining a grayscale image from the white+yellow image.
    3. Applying Gassuan Blur filter to the grayscaled image.
    4. Applying Canny Edge Detection.
        * The thresholds utilized were: low_threshold = 75, high_threshold = 150
    5. Obtaining an image with only the region of interest of the canny image.
        * The region of interest in this case was simply a trapezoid which vertices were tuned to produce best image over multiple images and videos. The main requirement of this region is to detect the right and left lane lines. 
    6. Apply Hough line detection on the region of interest image.
        * The hough transform was used to detect yellow and white lane lines in the region of interest image.

The remaining two steps are how the lines were processed and drawn on an annotated version of the original image:
    7. Processsing and averaging the lines
        * A line processing function was applied to filter line into left and right lane lines. First, the slope of all detected line was calculated and based on the slope as well as the position of the lines, they were divided into right and left lane lines. After that, each of the right and left lane lines were averaged with previous values in order to better reject noise and provide better line transitions in an annotated video

    8. Drawing the lines:
        * A function was designed to draw the obtained lines on the original image. First, the y position of the ends of right and left lines are pre-determened. For each line one y end would be in the bottom of the image while the other is cuurently set at aproximatly one third of the image's height. Using the y positions and the right and left line parameters obtained from step 7 (slope and intercept), the equivilent x position of the line ends are calculated and a one right and one left line is created and added to the original image.
